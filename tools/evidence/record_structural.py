r"""Create CF-04 verification records for the structural check (issue #366).

A verification record says exactly this: *this* fixture file, with *these*
bytes, was checked by *this* verifier, at *this* instant, and the outcome was
*this* (CF-04 section 3). This tool writes the records for the one check that
can be executed again right now: the structural check that
``tools/validate/validate.py`` performs.

What it does:

* runs the structural validation of the pack -- the same code the CI runs;
* for every fixture that passes it, writes one record holding the SHA-256 of
  the fixture file as it is on disk, ``checkedAt`` set to the instant the
  check actually ran, and ``method: "structural"``;
* writes nothing at all when a fixture does not validate, so a broken pack
  cannot produce a record that says it is fine.

What it never does (CF-04 section 3, and the rules issue #366 states):

* it never invents a record for a check that did not run;
* it never derives an instant from a date-only fixture header comment: a
  header such as ``Verified live on 2026-09-02`` names a day, not an instant,
  so no record is derived from it at all;
* it never records a live observation: a live record needs a saved capture,
  and this tool takes no capture;
* it never marks a fixture verified because a structural test passed. A
  structural record says the file is well formed. It says nothing about
  Stellar behavior, and it is not a live verification.

Where the records go is a maintainer decision that issue #366 lists as still
open. This tool writes them to ``<pack>/evidence/records/`` and takes
``--output-dir`` so the location can be changed in one place when the
decision is recorded.

Usage:
    python3 tools/evidence/record_structural.py PACK
        [--output-dir DIR] [--verifier-version VERSION] [--dry-run]

Requires Python 3.11+ and nothing outside the standard library.
