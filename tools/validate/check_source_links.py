"""Check fixture source references and header comment links on a schedule.

Scans fixture TOML files for:
  - `source_reference` field values (excluding CAP-XXXX identifiers)
  - `https://` URLs in header comments

Checks each URL with bounded redirects, timeout, 429 rate-limit handling
(treated as inconclusive), non-HTTP scheme protection, credential stripping,
and a strict address policy: only publicly routable destinations may be
contacted, on every redirect hop and on the 405 POST fallback, and the socket
dials the exact address that was validated rather than resolving the name a
second time.
Outputs a formatted markdown table suitable for the GitHub Actions job summary.
