# Security Policy

## Scope

This policy covers `ProtocolCanary-Fixtures`: the fixture files, JSON
schemas, and the structural validator under `tools/validate/`. It does not
cover `StellarCanary/Protocol-Canary` (the engine that consumes these
fixtures), which has its own security policy.

## Threat model: fixtures are untrusted input

This repository is public, and its fixtures are consumed by a tool that
may run in a project's CI pipeline. Every fixture file must be treated as
untrusted input by any consumer, including `Protocol-Canary` itself:

- **No executable fixture code.** Fixture files are TOML data. There is no
  `shell_command`, `exec`, `script`, `command`, `pre_run`, or `post_run`
  field, and none will be added. A pull request introducing one will be
  rejected regardless of stated purpose.
- **No secrets.** No fixture may contain a private key, seed phrase, or
  funded-account secret. The `soroban` surface's `source_account` field is
  a public account address only, used to build an *unsigned* transaction
  for simulation — never one that is signed or submitted.
- **No transaction submission.** Fixtures may require decoding, encoding,
  or read-only RPC calls (`getNetwork`, `getLatestLedger`) or Soroban
  *simulation*. No fixture may cause `Protocol-Canary` to submit a
  state-changing transaction to any network.
- **Parser-safety in mind.** `decode-failure` fixtures deliberately feed
  malformed input to an XDR decoder; when adding one, prefer inputs that
  exercise a specific, documented rejection (truncation, an invalid
  discriminant) over arbitrary fuzzing payloads, and note in the fixture's
  header comment what kind of malformation it demonstrates.

## Structural validator

`tools/validate/validate.py` only reads fixture files and reports
structural problems (schema conformance, duplicate IDs, missing files). It
never executes a fixture's assertion and never makes a network call.

The validator also enforces provenance rather than merely advising on it: a
fixture with no `source_reference` (or an empty one) is reported as an
**error**, so it fails validation and therefore CI, instead of passing
with a printed warning. This makes the shared validator — not a
pack-specific test — the common enforcement point for the claim that every
assertion is traceable to an authoritative upstream source.

## Audit status

No formal third-party security audit has been performed on this
repository. Confidence in the "fixtures are data, not code" claim comes
from the fixture schema itself (no executable field exists) and the
validator's tests, not from an external review. Confidence in fixture
provenance comes from the structural validator, which treats a missing
`source_reference` as an error (see above).

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a security issue in this repository — a fixture that could be
used to smuggle executable content past a consumer's TOML parser, a schema
gap that would let an untrusted `.toml` file crash a validator, or similar
— please open a private report via GitHub's "Report a vulnerability"
feature on this repository rather than filing a public issue. Include a
description of the issue, its impact, and steps to reproduce.

### Expected response times

| Stage | Expected time frame |
|---|---|
| We acknowledge your report | within **3 business days** |
| We give an initial assessment (severity, and whether it is in scope) | within **10 business days** |
| We ship a fix, or share a concrete remediation plan | within **30 calendar days** |
| Public disclosure | a date agreed with you, after a fix is available |

These are best-effort targets for a small project with no paid on-call
rotation, not a contractual SLA — but they are the times to hold us to. If
a window above passes with no reply, please follow up in the same private
report thread instead of disclosing publicly: a missed window means we lost
track of the report, not that it was dismissed or out of scope.

Disclosure is coordinated with you, never unilateral on either side: we
agree a date before any public write-up, and we will credit you in the
fix's release notes unless you would rather stay anonymous.
