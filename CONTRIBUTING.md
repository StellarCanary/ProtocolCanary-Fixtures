## Adding a fixture

A fixture is accepted only if a reviewer can answer all of the following
from the fixture file and its header comment alone, without running a
script:

1. What Stellar behavior does this test?
2. Why is that behavior important?
3. What protocol/CAP introduced it?
4. What is the expected result, and where does that expectation come from?
5. Is the test deterministic?

To add one:

**Short version** (the detailed walkthrough follows below):

- **Source it** — identify the upstream behavior from an authoritative source
  you have actually checked, and record it in `source_reference` plus a header
  comment explaining how the expected value was derived.
- **Write it** — stable, repository-unique `p<protocol>-<surface>-<slug>` ID;
  deterministic input; an explicit expected result using the surface's typed
  assertion vocabulary. Use `python3 tools/scaffold/new_fixture.py` to generate
  a skeleton template with explicit `TODO` placeholders.
- **Check it** — run `make validate` (or `python3 tools/validate/validate.py` directly).
- **Document, test & refresh it** — update the relevant `docs/protocol-NN.md`
  table (and the pack's `README.md` for a new CAP or surface), run
  `make test` (or `python3 -m unittest discover tests` directly), then run
  `make badge` so README.md's fixture-count badge reflects the new fixture.
- **Cover the pack** — if these are the first fixtures in a protocol pack, add
  that pack's dedicated `tests/test_pack_protocol_NN.py` file in the same
  change (see "Pack-level test files" below).

## Recording verification dates

When a fixture's header comment records when a live-network observation was
made (for example, the date an RPC endpoint or a simulation was last checked
to still return the documented result), write the date as **`YYYY-MM-DD` in
UTC** — e.g. `2026-09-02`. State the `UTC` designation the first time a date
appears in a header comment (or otherwise make clear it is UTC).

Rationale: these dates exist so a future reader can judge how stale an
observation may be. Recording them in local time would make a date recorded
near a day boundary ambiguous by up to a day, defeating that purpose.

1. **Identify the upstream behavior.** Read the CAP text, the upstream XDR
   definition, the upstream implementation, or the official release/API
   docs — in that order of preference. Never cite a source you have not
   actually checked describes the specific behavior you are asserting.
2. **Add source provenance.** Every fixture sets `source_reference` to an
   authoritative CAP identifier (`CAP-0083`) or an absolute `https://` URL —
   omitting it is a hard validator error, not a warning, and so is free text
   such as `see issue`, a relative link, `http://`, or a URL with
   credentials. A link into GitHub (`github.com/.../blob/...` or
   `raw.githubusercontent.com/...`) must name a full commit SHA or a release
   tag, not a branch such as `master`, so it keeps describing what the
   fixture was written against; documentation pages have no ref to pin.
   The host name in a `source_reference` URL may only contain ASCII letters,
   digits, `.` and `-` without empty labels or percent-encoding (non-ASCII hosts
   must be written in punycode). The header comment (a `#`
   comment block above the TOML body) explains, in prose, how the expected
   value was derived or observed — e.g. "built with the official
   `stellar-xdr` 28.0.0 crate against the CAP-0083 `StellarValue` type",
   not "looks right". If the header comment records *when* an observation
   was made, use the [date convention above](#recording-verification-dates).

   The validator also rejects non-public URL hosts in `source_reference` and
   non-public `endpointHost` values in verification evidence. It rejects
   localhost and common local-only suffixes, explicitly denied IPv4 ranges,
   and ambiguous noncanonical numeric IPv4 forms; bracketed IPv6 literals are
   not accepted in `source_reference` URLs. This policy is checked offline
   and does not resolve DNS, so it cannot detect a public-looking name such as
   `127.0.0.1.nip.io` that resolves to a private address. DNS, redirect, and
   runtime protections are outside this issue and belong to issue #390.
   One exception keeps the capture tool's dry run working: a verification
   record whose `network.name` is `local-mock` (what
   `tools/evidence/capture_live.py --local-endpoint` writes when it is pointed
   at the loopback mock server) may name `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` as its
   `endpointHost`. No other non-public host is accepted, with or without that
   label, and a record for a real network (`testnet`, `mainnet`, `futurenet`)
   may never name a loopback host.
3. **Define a stable ID.** Follow `p<protocol>-<surface>-<slug>` (e.g.
   `p28-xdr-cap85-external-ref-roundtrip`). IDs are lowercase, unique
   across the *entire* repository (the loader validates this across all
   `*.toml` files under a given `--fixtures-dir`, not just one file), and
   never renamed just because an implementation detail changed — if the
   semantic assertion itself changes, add a new fixture ID instead of
   silently repurposing an old one. To scaffold a skeleton fixture with the
   required five-section header comment and explicit placeholders, run
   `python3 tools/scaffold/new_fixture.py --surface <surface> --protocol <N> --id <id> --category <cat>`.
   The generated skeleton intentionally fails validation until every placeholder
   is replaced with verified evidence.
4. **Create deterministic input.** No fixture may depend on ledger state
   that changes between runs (a current ledger sequence, "the latest
   anything") unless the assertion is explicitly scoped as a live-network
   check and documented as such. For an XDR `decode-failure` fixture, follow
   the [malformed-input guidance in `SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md#parser-safety-in-mind):
   prefer a specific documented rejection, such as truncation or an invalid
   discriminant, over arbitrary fuzzing input, and explain the malformation in
   the fixture's header comment.
5. **Define an explicit expected result** using the assertion vocabulary
   the target surface actually supports (see "Fixture schema" below) — no
   generic string matching when a typed assertion exists.
6. **Validate the fixture**: `make validate` — or
   `python3 tools/validate/validate.py` directly. Only errors produce a
   non-zero exit code: the validator exits 1 if the report contains at
   least one error and 0 otherwise. CI runs this exact command
   (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`), so that exit code is what CI
   treats as pass/fail — any error fails the workflow on your PR. In
   particular, a missing `source_reference` (step 2) is an error, so it
   fails CI rather than passing with a printed advisory. Add
   `--format json` for the same run as a single JSON document on stdout
   (see [README.md](README.md#validation)); the exit codes are unchanged.
7. **Add/update documentation**: the relevant `docs/protocol-NN.md` table
   and, if you added a new CAP or surface, the pack's `README.md`.
8. **Run the repository tests**: `make test` — or
   `python3 -m unittest discover tests` directly.
9. **Refresh the fixture-count badge** in `README.md`: `make badge` — or
   `python3 tools/badge/badge.py` directly. CI runs
   `python3 tools/badge/badge.py --check` and fails if the committed badge
   no longer matches the fixture tree (see
   [README.md](README.md#fixtures-badge)).
10. **If you populated a previously empty pack**, add that pack's
    `tests/test_pack_protocol_NN.py` in this same change — see
    "Pack-level test files" below. A pack-level test is *not* a substitute for
    any of steps 6-9, and `tests/test_validate.py` does not cover it.

Before pushing, `make check` runs all of the above in one command, in
the same order CI (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) runs them.

> **Note**: Do not add a `manifest.toml` or similar discovery/enumeration file. The loader recursively treats every `*.toml` file under `--fixtures-dir` as a fixture, so a manifest `.toml` file would be mis-parsed as a malformed fixture and fail the run (see [README.md](README.md#repository-relationship)).

## Pack-level test files

Every populated protocol pack ships with a dedicated pack-level test file,
`tests/test_pack_protocol_NN.py`, next to the generic `tests/test_validate.py`.
[`tests/test_pack_protocol_28.py`](tests/test_pack_protocol_28.py) is the
existing example: a structural, offline suite (no network, no fixture
execution) asserting that the pack matches its own documented inventory, for
example that

- every fixture under `protocol-NN/` targets `protocol = NN` and carries a
  `source_reference`;
- the set of fixture IDs per surface matches the pack's documented inventory
  exactly;
- fixture IDs named in the `## [Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` still
  exist, or are explicitly marked removed/deprecated;
- the pack's own documented invariants hold (for protocol-28, the "no fixture
  claims CAP-0086" gap guard, and the "protocol-27 is still intentionally
  empty" policy check).

This is separate from `tests/test_validate.py`, which only proves the generic
format rules. The validator cannot know which fixtures a given pack is
*supposed* to contain — the pack-level file is what keeps a pack's
`docs/protocol-NN.md`, its `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and its actual
`protocol-NN/` directory from drifting apart. (The "Protocol version range"
note in the [Fixture schema](#fixture-schema) section covers the related case
of a mistyped `protocol` value passing structural validation.)

**When you populate a new protocol pack** — for example
[`protocol-27/README.md`](protocol-27/README.md), which anticipates exactly
this future change — add the equivalent `tests/test_pack_protocol_NN.py` in
the same change that adds the pack's first fixtures. Model it on the
protocol-28 file: replace `EXPECTED_IDS_BY_SURFACE` with your pack's verified
inventory, assert `protocol = NN` for every fixture, and drop the invariants
that only make sense for a different or empty pack. No workflow change is
needed — CI already discovers the file through
`python3 -m unittest discover tests`.

No fixture should be merged solely because it makes some consumer's CI
green. If you cannot pin down the exact expected wire representation or
host-function behavior from an authoritative source, **stop** — do not
guess a byte sequence or invent an undocumented host function because it
"looks right". Open an issue describing the gap instead.

## Fixture schema

This repository's fixture files must conform exactly to what
`StellarCanary/Protocol-Canary`'s `canary-fixtures`/`canary-xdr`/
`canary-rpc`/`canary-soroban` crates actually parse — that implementation,
documented in its `docs/fixture-contract.md`, is authoritative. This
repository does not define its own competing schema. `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json`
here is a convenience JSON Schema mirroring that contract for editor/CI
linting; if the two ever disagree, `Protocol-Canary`'s implementation wins
and this repository's schema/validator must be corrected to match — never
the other way around.

That schema is kept from silently drifting away from
`tools/validate/validate.py` by `tools/validate/schema_sync.py` — a
standard-library-only check (there is no third-party JSON Schema engine in
this repository's dependency set) that compares the schema's enums and
required-field lists against the validator's constants. The repository test
suite runs it against the shipped schema (`tests/test_validate.py`), so a
validator change that adds, removes, or renames a rule — a new XDR `type`, a
new RPC `method`, a newly required field, a new capability, and so on —
fails CI unless the same pull request updates `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json`
to match. `python3 tools/validate/schema_sync.py` runs the check on its own
and exits non-zero on any disagreement.

The fixture format is versioned: `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json` is titled
"Protocol Canary fixture (schema_version 1)". **Every protocol pack must
state, in its `docs/protocol-NN.md` or the pack's `README.md`, which fixture
format `schema_version` its fixtures were written against** — the
`protocol-28` pack, for instance, targets `schema_version 1`. The schema
version is a per-pack property recorded in prose, not a field repeated in
each fixture file. Recording it from the start is what lets a future format
revision (e.g. `schema_version 2`) be scoped per pack rather than
retrofitted by guesswork.

### Protocol filtering is skip-not-fail

A fixture's `protocol` field declares which protocol pack it belongs to.
When a consumer runs with a protocol filter — for example
`stellar-canary check --fixtures-dir <protocol-NN-directory> --protocol 28 --json` — every
fixture whose `protocol` does not equal the requested value is **skipped,
not failed**. This matches `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json`'s `protocol`
description verbatim: "A run whose `--protocol` does not match is skipped,
not failed."

The `--fixtures-dir` argument must point at a `protocol-NN/` pack directory
(e.g. `protocol-28/`), not at the repository root. The repository root
contains test vectors under `tests/vectors/` (some deliberately invalid) that
the loader would attempt to parse as fixtures, causing the run to fail.
See README.md "Repository relationship" for details.

Once this repository holds more than one populated protocol pack (see the
`protocol-27/` pack, expected to be populated eventually), a run scoped with
`--protocol` over a staging directory containing multiple `protocol-NN/`
directories reports fewer fixtures than the tree contains, and a mostly
skipped run is **not** a validation failure. Do not read a low fixture count
under `--protocol` filtering as something being wrong with the fixtures.
`tools/validate/validate.py` itself does not filter by protocol — it
validates every fixture it finds — so use it (or `make validate`) when you
want the whole corpus checked regardless of pack.

Common fields (every fixture):

```toml
id = "unique-string"
protocol = 28
surface = "xdr" # | "rpc" | "soroban"
category = "cap-0083"
description = "..."
source_reference = "CAP-0083"          # required for protocol-specific fixtures; missing it is an error
required_capabilities = []              # optional, see fixture-contract.md
input_file = "..."                      # optional, path relative to this file (currently unused by any fixture)
expected_file = "..."                   # optional (currently unused by any fixture)
```

`input_file` and `expected_file` are the external-file alternatives to an
XDR fixture's inline `value_base64`/`expected_base64` fields: a fixture
supplies a given value one way or the other, not both. Only the referenced
file's *existence* is checked by the validator — never its contents. Prefer
an external file for large payloads (e.g. a multi-kilobyte binary blob that
would make the `*.toml` unreadable) and inline base64 for short XDR values,
which is what every fixture in this repository currently does.

### Protocol version range

`protocol` is **intentionally unbounded above**. The validator checks only
that it is an integer `>= 1`; it deliberately does not maintain a list of
supported Stellar protocol versions, so shipping a new protocol never
requires a validator change here. The trade-off is that a stray or typo'd
value (for example `82` where `28` was meant) passes structural validation
silently. Catching that is a pack-level responsibility, not the validator's:
a pack's own test suite asserts that every fixture under `protocol-NN/`
targets `NN` — see `tests/test_pack_protocol_28.py`'s
`test_every_fixture_targets_protocol_28` — so a mistyped `protocol` is caught
there, and a new pack should add the equivalent test.

Per-surface body (everything else in the file):

| Surface | Fields |
|---|---|
| `xdr` | `type` (currently `"StellarValue"`, `"ContractExecutable"` or `"ScVal"`), `kind` (`"decode-success"` \| `"decode-failure"` \| `"roundtrip"` \| `"encode-equals"`), `value_base64`, `expected_base64` (only for `encode-equals`) |
| `rpc` | `method` (`"get-network"` \| `"get-latest-ledger"` \| `"get-health"` \| `"get-version-info"` \| `"get-fee-stats"` \| `"get-ledger-entries"` \| `"get-transaction"` \| `"get-ledgers"` \| `"get-transactions"` \| `"get-events"`), one or more `[[assert]]` tables (`{kind, field, value?, expected_type?, values?, min?, max?}`), optional `[request]` table |
| `soroban` | `source_account`, `contract_id`, `function`, `sequence_number`, optional `[[args]]` tables (`{kind, value?}`; kinds `"bool"`, `"u32"`, `"i32"`, `"u64"`, `"i64"`, `"i128"`, `"u128"`, `"i256"`, `"u256"`, `"void"`, `"duration"`, `"timepoint"`, `"symbol"`, `"string"`, `"bytes"`, `"address"`, `"vec"`, `"map"`; `void` omits `value`, `vec`/`map` nest at most 8 levels), `[expect]` (`{kind = "simulation-success"}` or `{kind = "simulation-error", message_contains?}`) |

### Unknown top-level fields

Both `tools/validate/validate.py` and `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json`
reject an unrecognized top-level field (F-031): the top level of a fixture
is closed to the union of the common fields plus exactly the keys its own
`surface` consumes, and the schema sets `additionalProperties: false` on
every object, including the `[[assert]]` tables and the `[expect]` table.
The validator's diagnostic names the offending key
(`unexpected top-level key 'soure_reference'; ...`), so a typo'd field name
fails loudly instead of being silently ignored while the intended field is
reported missing.

Introducing a genuinely new fixture field therefore needs the key added to
`SURFACE_FIELDS`/`COMMON_OPTIONAL_FIELDS` in `tools/validate/validate.py`
and to `properties` in `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json` in the same change
that first uses it — and, as before, the loader contract in
`Protocol-Canary`'s `docs/fixture-contract.md` stays authoritative: add the
field upstream first, never here alone.

### Protocol filtering behavior

The `protocol` field specifies the Stellar protocol version targeted by the fixture. In accordance with [`schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json`](schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json) (which notes that *"A run whose `--protocol` does not match is skipped, not failed"*), runners filtering fixtures via `--protocol <version>` silently skip fixtures targeting other protocol versions rather than failing the run. When this repository contains fixtures across multiple protocol packs (e.g. `protocol-27/` and `protocol-28/`), executing a run with `--protocol` filtering skips fixtures for other versions by design; this skip-not-fail behavior is normal and should not be misconstrued as a validation failure.

If you need an XDR `type` this repository does not yet support, that is a
`Protocol-Canary` limitation, not something to work around here — open an
issue/PR against `Protocol-Canary`'s `canary-xdr` crate first (see its own
`CONTRIBUTING.md`), and only add the fixture here once that support exists
and is released.

The same applies to an RPC `method` outside the methods the table above lists:
open an issue/PR against `Protocol-Canary`'s `canary-rpc` crate first, and only
add the fixture here once that support exists and is released.

### The engine-vocabulary vector

The names this repository's validator accepts — XDR types and kinds, RPC
methods, RPC assertion kinds, Soroban expectation kinds and the surfaces —
must be exactly the names `Protocol-Canary`'s parsers accept. The shared
list is `tests/fixtures/engine-vocabulary.json`: one array per vocabulary,
the engine source file each array was read from, and the `engineCommit` (a
full 40-character commit SHA) they were read at.
`tests/test_engine_vocabulary_parity.py` compares every array with
`tools/validate/validate.py`'s constant and with the matching enum in
`schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json`, so a name the engine accepts but the
validator rejects — or the other way round — fails the test suite by name
instead of surfacing later as a fixture one side accepts and the other
rejects.

To update the vector when the engine changes:

1. Read the engine sources named next to each array in the vector
   (`crates/canary-xdr/src/decoder.rs`, `crates/canary-xdr/src/runner.rs`,
   `crates/canary-rpc/src/request.rs`, `crates/canary-rpc/src/runner.rs`,
   `crates/canary-soroban/src/runner.rs`, `crates/canary-core/src/model.rs`)
   at the `Protocol-Canary` commit you are moving to.
2. Rewrite the affected arrays and set `engineCommit` to that commit's full
   SHA. Only names the parser accepts belong in an array: a name a contract
   document describes but the parser rejects goes into
   `contractOnlyNotImplemented` instead.
3. Change `tools/validate/validate.py`'s constant and the matching enum in
   `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json` in the same pull request, and update the
   documents that list the vocabulary (`README.md`, the per-surface table
   above, `docs/contracts.md`).
4. Run `python3 -m unittest discover tests`; the parity test must pass
   before the pull request is opened.

A name the engine's parser accepts but this repository's validator does not
yet accept is recorded in `engineOnlyNotYetAccepted`, together with the
engine commit that added it. That list is documentation only — the parity
test does not compare it — and moving the pin to that commit is a
deliberate change that has to update the arrays, the validator and the
schema together.

## What never belongs in a fixture

- Shell commands, scripts, or any embedded JavaScript/Python/Bash/Rust —
  fixtures are declarative data, never code. There is no `exec`,
  `shell_command`, `pre_run`, or `post_run` field, and none will ever be
  added.
- Private keys, seed phrases, or funded-account secrets.
- A request for `Protocol-Canary` to submit a real, state-changing
  transaction. Fixtures may require simulation, decoding/encoding, or a
  read-only RPC call — never submission.
- A claim about current live network state (a specific ledger sequence, a
  specific balance) unless the fixture is explicitly and narrowly scoped as
  a live-network check with its assumptions documented.
- A `manifest.toml` or any discovery/enumeration file. The loader recursively
  parses every `*.toml` file under `--fixtures-dir` as a fixture, so a manifest
  file would be mis-parsed as a malformed fixture and fail validation (see
  [README.md](README.md#repository-relationship)).

## Portable paths and safe text

Every fixture pack is checked out and extracted on Windows as well as on Linux
and macOS, and fixture files are reviewed as text but consumed as data. Two
rules therefore apply to every change:

- **Use portable path names.** A pack-relative path segment cannot be a
  Windows reserved device name (`CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1`-`COM9`,
  `LPT1`-`LPT9`) in any letter case or with any extension, cannot end in a dot
  or a space, and cannot contain `<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `|`, `?` or `*`. Names
  such as `console.toml`, `p28-xdr-con.toml` and `lpt10.toml` are fine;
  `con.toml`, `aux.v2.toml` and `bad./fixture.toml` are not. The shared rule
  is in `tools/validate/portable_names.py` and is enforced by the validator,
  the registry generator and the archive verifier, so a pack cannot pass one
  tool and fail another. Unicode look-alikes of a reserved name (for example
  a Cyrillic `С` in `СON.toml`) are different names and are allowed.
- **Use safe text.** Fixture `.toml` files and verification evidence `.json`
  files passed with `--evidence` must be valid UTF-8 and must not contain
  bidirectional override or isolate characters (`U+202A`-`U+202E` and
  `U+2066`-`U+2069`), zero-width or other invisible format characters, a byte
  order mark outside the first character of the file, or control characters
  other than tab, line feed and carriage return. Accented and non-Latin text
  is welcome and remains valid. The validator reports the file, line, column
  and code point (for example `U+202E`) and never rewrites the file.

Both rules are repository contracts, not style advice: a fixture that breaks
one fails `make validate` (and therefore CI), and the archive and registry
tools reject the pack before it can be released. The full procedure for
packaging, verifying, attesting, and publishing a pack release is documented in
[`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md).

## Pack limits

Fixture packs are subject to extraction limits approved under decision D-06
(CF-02 section 7 and CF-06 section 6 in `Protocol-Canary`), enforced
identically by `tools/validate/validate.py`, `tools/registry/generate.py`,
and `tools/pack/pack.py`:

- **File count**: at most 2,000 member files per pack.
- **Total uncompressed size**: at most 16 MiB (16,777,216 bytes) across all
  pack members.
- **Per-file size**: at most 1 MiB (1,048,576 bytes) for any individual pack
  member.
- **Path depth**: at most 8 `/`-separated segments for any member path relative
  to the pack root (including the file name).

Pack members are defined by CF-02 section 2: every `*.toml` file (excluding
anything under `.git`), plus every payload file referenced by `input_file` or
`expected_file`. Non-member files (such as `README.md`) are outside the pack
and do not count toward these limits during validation.

## Deprecating a fixture

Do not silently delete a fixture that is still referenced by a released
`Protocol-Canary` version's tests or documentation. Mark it deprecated in
its header comment with the reason, note it in `CHANGELOG.md`, and remove
it in a later, separate change once nothing depends on it.

Note that deprecation is communicated **only** via this header comment
convention. There is intentionally no `deprecated` field or equivalent
structured marker in the schema. This is by design: deprecation is meant
for humans reading the fixture or reviewing a PR, while automated consumers
parsing the file via the schema treat it like any other fixture until it is
fully removed.

## Common validation errors

Quick reference for what contributors hit most often. Each line is the error as
`make validate` reports it, followed by the usual cause and fix.

| Error | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tomllib'` | Your `python3` is older than 3.11. `tomllib` is a 3.11+ stdlib module and the validator has no third-party dependencies, so there is nothing to install — use a newer interpreter (CI runs 3.11.16). |
| `no 'source_reference' set; ...` | The fixture omits `source_reference`. Add it: a CAP id (`CAP-0083`) or an authoritative URL such as the RPC method reference. It is an **error**, not a warning. |
| `field 'category' is too vague ('misc'); use a specific CAP/topic slug` | `category` is one of `misc`, `other`, `test`, `general`. Use a specific CAP or topic slug instead, e.g. `cap-0083` or `network`. |
| `field 'source_reference' links to GitHub ref 'master', which is a branch name and moves; pin ...` | The link follows a branch. Replace the branch with the full commit SHA of the revision you checked (`.../blob/<40-hex commit>/...`) or a release tag. |
| `field 'source_reference' must be a CAP identifier such as 'CAP-0083' or an absolute https:// URL ...` | The value is free text or a relative link. Use `CAP-0083`-style identifiers, or the full `https://` URL of the page you checked. |
| `duplicate fixture id '...': already defined in ...` | Two fixtures share an `id`. Ids must be unique across the whole tree — rename the new one. |
| `unexpected key(s) '...' in 'expect'; canary-soroban accepts only ['kind', 'message_contains']` | Unlike the top level of a fixture, `[expect]` is closed: `canary-soroban` rejects an unknown key there. Usually a typo (`message_contain`) or a field that belongs at the top level. |
| `expect.message_contains must be a string, got ...` / `expect.message_contains must not be empty; ...` | The loader reads the field with `toml::Value::as_str`, so a non-string is silently dropped and an empty string matches every message — either way the fixture asserts less than it appears to. Quote the needle, or omit the key entirely to assert only that the simulation fails. |
| `field 'expected_base64' is only allowed for kind 'encode-equals', not 'roundtrip'` | `expected_base64` states the expected encoding, and only an `encode-equals` fixture has one; the loader rejects the field for every other kind. Use `kind = "encode-equals"`, or drop the field. |
| `README.md's fixtures badge is stale; run ...` | You added or removed a `*.toml`, so the fixture count in README.md is now wrong. Run `make badge` and commit the result. |
| `git diff --exit-code` shows `registry-v1.json` as changed (CI step `check-registry`) | You changed a fixture or payload without regenerating the pack's registry manifest. Run `python3 tools/registry/generate.py protocol-28` (or, for an empty baseline, `python3 tools/registry/generate.py protocol-29 --allow-empty --protocol 29`) and commit the regenerated `registry-v1.json`. |

`make check` runs these in CI's order (`validate` → `badge-check` → `test`) and
stops at the first failure, so fix and re-run after each change rather than
chasing several reported errors at once.

## Updating CHANGELOG.md

Every user-visible change — a new fixture, a validator behavior change, new
tooling — gets an entry under `CHANGELOG.md`'s `## [Unreleased]` section in
the same pull request that makes the change.

Each entry must include a link to the pull request that introduced it, so a
reader can jump straight from the changelog line to the review discussion
and the diff:

```markdown
- `p28-xdr-example` — what the fixture checks.
  ([PR #123](https://github.com/StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Fixtures/pull/123))
```

If a change is pushed directly to `main` without a pull request, link the
introducing commit instead:

```markdown
- Something else. ([abc1234](https://github.com/StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Fixtures/commit/abc1234))
```

A changelog entry without one of these links is not ready for review.

### Automated CHANGELOG validation (rule [F-055])

Pull request CI validates that a changelog entry is present whenever a pull
request modifies governed files:

- **Governed paths** requiring an entry under `## [Unreleased]`:
  - Protocol packs (`protocol-*/`)
  - Schemas (`schemas/`)
  - Tools and scripts (`tools/`)
- **Exempt paths** that do not require an entry when changed on their own:
  - Documentation (`docs/`, root `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`)
  - Tests (`tests/`)
  - CI workflows (`.github/`)
  - Repository configuration (`Makefile`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`)

If a pull request modifies governed files without modifying `CHANGELOG.md`, the
pull request CI job will fail.

#### Opting out with the `no-changelog` label

If a pull request touches governed files but represents an internal refactoring,
code cleanup, or other non-user-facing change that does not warrant a changelog
entry, apply the **`no-changelog`** label to the pull request. CI reads pull
request labels from the event payload and bypasses the changelog check when
`no-changelog` is present.

#### Checking changelog status locally

Contributors can check changelog compliance locally before opening or pushing a
PR:

```bash
# Compare working branch against origin/main:
python3 tools/validate/check_changelog.py --base origin/main

# Or check specific changed files:
python3 tools/validate/check_changelog.py protocol-28/xdr/fixture.toml CHANGELOG.md

# Or via make:
make check-changelog
```

*(Note: CI does not require the changelog entry to include the PR number at check
time, since the PR number is not known before the pull request is opened. You can
add the link with the assigned PR number before merge.)*

## Development setup

No build system is required. `tools/validate/validate.py` uses only the
Python 3.11+ standard library (`tomllib`), so there is nothing to install.

For convenience, a `Makefile` wraps the commands CI runs:

- `make validate` — structural fixture validation.
- `make badge` — regenerates README.md's fixture-count badge.
- `make badge-check` — fails if that badge is stale.
- `make test` — the repository test suite.
- `make check-changelog` — verify CHANGELOG entry for changed files.
- `make check-links` — check fixture source reference links across all packs.
- `make coverage` — the test suite under branch coverage of `tools/`, failing
  below `.coveragerc`'s threshold. Needs the development-only dependency
  `pip install coverage==7.16.2` (CI installs that exact version), so it is
  the one target not included in `make check`.
- `make check` — all of them, in CI's order, stopping at the first failure.

The underlying commands work identically if run directly, so `make` is
not a requirement for contributing — it only saves typing.

## Linting

CI runs `ruff check .` with the rules in `ruff.toml`, using the pinned
version (Ruff 0.17.2). To run it locally:

```
pip install ruff==0.17.2
ruff check .          # report findings
ruff check . --fix    # apply the safe automatic fixes
```

A new Python file has to pass `ruff check .`. A genuine exception goes in
`ruff.toml` with a one-line reason, not in a blanket `# noqa`. Formatting
(`ruff format`) is not enforced.

## Coverage

CI measures branch coverage of the Python tools on one operating system
(`ubuntu-latest`, the `coverage` job in `.github/workflows/validate.yml`) so
the number stays comparable between runs. The configuration lives in
`.coveragerc`:

- `branch = true`, `source = tools` — branch coverage of everything under
  `tools/`;
- `fail_under = 95` — CI fails when the total drops below this. It sits a few
  points under the **97.53% baseline measured on 2026-10-20** (after the tests
  added for #335); the comment at the top of `.coveragerc` records the exact
  measurement command and commit.

The job appends the per-file `coverage report -m` table to the job summary and
fails below the threshold. To run exactly what CI runs:

```bash
pip install coverage==7.16.2
coverage run --branch --source=tools -m unittest discover tests
coverage report -m   # exits non-zero when below .coveragerc's fail_under
```

or simply `make coverage`. `coverage` is a development tool only: the test
suite itself has no third-party dependencies and must keep working without it.
When the baseline is deliberately raised, update `fail_under` and the baseline
comment in `.coveragerc` in the same change.

## Cross-platform and multi-Python CI matrix

In addition to the primary validation job on `ubuntu-latest` with Python `3.11.16`
and the single-platform branch coverage job, CI (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`)
runs a cross-platform and multi-Python validation matrix (`validate-matrix`)
covering:

- `windows-latest` with Python `3.11`
- `macos-latest` with Python `3.11`
- `ubuntu-latest` with Python `3.12`
- `ubuntu-latest` with Python `3.13`

(On Windows and macOS, `"3.11"` floats to the latest available prebuilt 3.11
binary because CPython 3.11.10+ is in source-only security-fix status and
`actions/python-versions` only publishes prebuilt binaries for Ubuntu at
3.11.16).

Each matrix cell runs the same validation suite as the primary job:
structural fixture validation, verification record checks, fixture-count badge
currency, and the unit test suite.

This matrix ensures that fixtures, schemas, tooling (`tools/`), and tests
remain strictly portable across operating systems (normalizing paths with
`/` separators, using UTF-8 text encoding, avoiding Windows reserved filenames,
and handling CRLF vs LF line endings deterministically) and compatible with
newer Python releases.

## Weekly engine-drift check

`.github/workflows/engine-drift.yml` builds `StellarCanary/Protocol-Canary`'s
`main` and runs this repository's `protocol-28` pack against the freshly built
`stellar-canary`, so an engine-side loading change that starts rejecting or
reinterpreting the fixtures is caught in the week it merges rather than at
release time (#331). It runs

- weekly (Mondays 05:17 UTC) via `schedule`, and
- on demand via `workflow_dispatch`, with an optional `engine_ref` input
  naming the Protocol-Canary branch or tag to build (default `main`).

It never runs on pull requests or pushes, holds read-only permissions, uses no
secrets, and is deliberately **not** a required check — a red engine-drift run
is a signal to investigate, not a merge blocker. The job summary records the
engine commit that was built and the exact commands that were run; on failure
it names the requested ref and, when available, the engine commit. Every
action in the workflow is pinned to a full commit SHA.

To lint the workflow: `actionlint .github/workflows/engine-drift.yml`.
To reproduce what it runs locally:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/StellarCanary/Protocol-Canary.git /tmp/protocol-canary
(cd /tmp/protocol-canary && cargo build --release --locked)
pack=$PWD/protocol-28
work=$(mktemp -d) && cd "$work"
printf 'version = 1\nprotocol = 28\n\n[tests]\nxdr = true\nrpc = false\nsoroban = false\n' > .stellar-canary.toml
/tmp/protocol-canary/target/release/stellar-canary fixtures --fixtures-dir "$pack" --protocol 28
/tmp/protocol-canary/target/release/stellar-canary check --fixtures-dir "$pack" --protocol 28 --json --no-cache
```

The XDR-only `.stellar-canary.toml` mirrors the engine's own
`scripts/check-canonical-pack.sh`: only the offline surface executes, so the
run needs no network beyond cloning and building.

## Checking fixture source reference links

Fixture provenance links (`source_reference` values and `https://` URLs in
header comments) are checked automatically on a schedule in CI
(`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) to detect link rot without delaying
routine pull requests.

Contributors can run this check locally at any time:

```bash
python3 tools/validate/check_source_links.py
```

By default, the script scans all `protocol-*` directories. You can also specify
individual directories or fixture files, and customize timeouts or redirect bounds:

```bash
# Check a specific protocol pack:
python3 tools/validate/check_source_links.py protocol-28

# Adjust timeout and redirect bounds:
python3 tools/validate/check_source_links.py --timeout 15 --max-redirects 10

# Write the markdown report to a file (like $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY):
python3 tools/validate/check_source_links.py --summary-file summary.md
```

The script prints a markdown table with `URL`, `Fixture File`, and `Result`
(`OK`, `Failed`, or `Inconclusive`). HTTP 429 rate limits are classified as
inconclusive and do not trigger a non-zero exit code.

### Address policy: public destinations only

Fixture files are contributor-controlled content, but the scheduled job runs
with the repository runner's network, so the checker only ever contacts
publicly routable internet hosts. Before **every** request -- the first URL,
every redirect hop, and the empty-POST fallback used after an HTTP 405 -- the
destination's host is resolved with `socket.getaddrinfo` and the request is
refused (`Failed (refused: non-public address)`) if **any** answer is not
globally routable. Refused categories: loopback, private, link-local
(`169.254.0.0/16`, `fe80::/10`), unique-local (`fc00::/7`), carrier-grade NAT
(`100.64.0.0/10`), multicast, reserved and unspecified addresses, after
unwrapping IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (`::ffff:a.b.c.d`). IP literals in all
supported notations are recognised without any DNS query, including decimal,
 hexadecimal and octal IPv4 forms (`http://2130706433/`, `http://0x7f.1/`,
`http://0177.0.0.1/`) and bracketed IPv6 (`http://[::1]/`).

The socket then dials the exact address that was validated, under the
original host name (so TLS server name indication and certificate
verification are unaffected); the name is never resolved a second time, so a
changed DNS answer cannot redirect the connection after validation. The
policy is enforced in code and defaults to strict: there is no command-line
flag or environment variable that can weaken the job's policy -- tests that
need to reach a loopback test server inject a permissive policy in-process.
