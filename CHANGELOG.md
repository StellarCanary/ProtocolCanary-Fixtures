# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

Every entry below links to the pull request that introduced it — or, for
changes that were pushed directly to `main` without a pull request, to the
introducing commit — so each line can be traced back to its review
discussion and diff. New entries must include that link; see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-changelogmd).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository scaffold: `schemas/`, `tools/validate/`, `tests/`, `docs/`,
  CI validation workflow.
  ([757e1e7], [5142110], [764111c], [806549c], [c8d8e75])
- `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json` documenting the fixture format
  implemented by `StellarCanary/Protocol-Canary`'s `canary-fixtures` crate.
  ([5142110])
- `tools/validate/validate.py`: structural validator (schema conformance,
  unique IDs, protocol/surface enums, source references, referenced-file
  existence). No live-network or execution behavior. ([764111c])
- Protocol 28 compatibility pack (`protocol-28/`): ([c5b882c])
  - `p28-xdr-cap83-empty-tx-set` — CAP-0083 `StellarValue`
    (`STELLAR_VALUE_EMPTY_TX_SET`) round-trip, built with the official
    `stellar-xdr` 28.0.0 crate. ([2b3d07b])
  - `p28-xdr-cap83-empty-tx-set-malformed` — a truncated encoding of the
    same CAP-0083 `StellarValue` shape is correctly rejected, mirroring the
    CAP-0085 malformed-input fixture. ([PR #97])
  - `p28-xdr-cap85-external-ref-roundtrip` and
    `p28-xdr-cap85-external-ref-malformed` — CAP-0085
    `ContractExecutable` (`CONTRACT_EXECUTABLE_EXTERNAL_REF`) round-trip
    and malformed-input rejection. ([3f097d1])
  - `p28-rpc-network` — Protocol 28 `getNetwork` identity check, verified
    live against `soroban-testnet.stellar.org`. ([0f54e20])
  - `p28-rpc-latest-ledger` — Protocol 28 `getLatestLedger` identity check
    (a numeric `sequence`, `protocolVersion` 28, a string ledger `id`, and
    no `getNetwork`-only fields), verified live against
    `soroban-testnet.stellar.org` with `stellar-canary` 0.1.1.
    ([PR #236])
  - `p28-soroban-native-asset-name` — a Soroban simulation smoke fixture
    (SEP-41 `name()` on the reserved native-asset contract), verified live
    against `soroban-testnet.stellar.org`. ([ea8b63b])
- `docs/protocol-28.md` documenting exactly what this pack checks, what it
  does not, and why. ([806549c])
- A fixture-count badge in README.md's badge row, plus `tools/badge/badge.py`,
  a stdlib-only generator/checker that counts fixtures using the same
  discovery rule as the validator and rewrites only the marked region of
  README.md. `make badge` regenerates it; CI runs `--check`, so the number
  cannot silently drift from the fixture tree. ([ab88ca4])
- `tools/validate/schema_sync.py`, a standard-library-only check that fails
  when `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json`'s enums or required-field lists drift
  from `tools/validate/validate.py`'s constants, with coverage in
  `tests/test_validate.py`. `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json` now also lists
  `source_reference` as required, matching the validator. ([PR #231])
- `tests/test_documentation_vocabulary.py`, which parses README.md's
  assertion-vocabulary table and CONTRIBUTING.md's per-surface field table and
  asserts they name exactly the RPC methods, assertion kinds and surfaces
  `tools/validate/validate.py` accepts — the documentation leg
  `schema_sync.py` does not cover, and the drift that issue #162 was about.
  ([PR #236])

### Changed

- The structural validator now rejects an empty-string `description`,
  matching `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json`'s `minLength: 1` and the
  existing `id`/`category` checks; a regression test covers the case.
  ([PR #232])
- Documented that `protocol` is intentionally unbounded above: a code
  comment in `tools/validate/validate.py` and a new "Protocol version
  range" subsection in `CONTRIBUTING.md` state that a stray or typo'd value
  is expected to be caught by pack-level tests rather than by structural
  validation. ([PR #232])
- `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json`'s RPC `assert.value` property gained a
  description explaining that its type is intentionally unconstrained but
  must match the JSON type the targeted RPC field actually returns.
  ([PR #232])
- README.md's Validation section now distinguishes the structural
  conformance CI re-checks on every run from the point-in-time live-network
  verification recorded in fixture header comments and `docs/protocol-28.md`.
  ([PR #232])
- The structural validator now treats a missing `source_reference` as an
  error rather than a warning, so a fixture with no authoritative provenance
  reference fails `tools/validate/validate.py` (and therefore CI) instead of
  passing with a printed advisory. `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `README.md` and `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json` were updated to describe
  the rule as enforced. ([PR #143])
- Documented the reciprocal RPC type-list maintenance relationship, linked
  the malformed-input review guidance into the fixture walkthrough, and
  recorded the current CAP-0085 CLI status and tracked deployment gap.
  ([PR #176])
- `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json` gained a top-level `examples` array
  containing one minimal, schema-valid XDR fixture mirroring
  `protocol-28/xdr/cap-0085/p28-xdr-cap85-external-ref-roundtrip.toml`,
  so schema-aware editors (e.g. Even Better TOML/Taplo) can offer a
  worked completion example.
- `protocol-27/README.md` now links its "contribution policy" reference
  directly to `CONTRIBUTING.md`, where the pack-population verification
  policy is spelled out.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`'s "New or changed fixture(s)?" section
  now links directly to `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s "Adding a fixture" checklist
  alongside the README's Provenance reference, so PR authors are pointed at
  the fuller step-by-step walkthrough (source, determinism, ID stability)
  that the template's review questions map to. ([PR #219])
- README.md's fixture-format section states which RPC methods the `rpc`
  surface currently supports (`get-network` and `get-latest-ledger`) and
  links `CONTRIBUTING.md` for adding a new one. ([PR #231])
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s fixture-schema section documents that `--protocol`
  filtering skips, rather than fails, fixtures whose `protocol` does not
  match, cross-referencing `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json`, and describes
  the schema/validator sync enforcement added above. ([PR #231])
- `docs/protocol-28.md` records why an RPC fixture can only assert fields
  `canary-rpc` exposes to assertions: each response is serialized into its
  typed model (`NetworkInfo`, `LatestLedger`) before asserts run, so
  `getLatestLedger`'s raw `closeTime`/`headerXdr`/`metadataXdr` are not
  observable, and a `field-absent` assertion is meaningful only for a field
  the other method would report. ([PR #236])
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`'s "Tests performed" checklist now
  includes `python3 tools/badge/badge.py --check`, the CI step that fails a
  fixture PR whose badge was not regenerated. ([PR #236])
- `tests/test_validate.py`'s invalid-RPC-method test now asserts the
  rejection message quotes the rejected method and enumerates the accepted
  ones, for both `get-balance` and `getTransactions`, instead of only
  checking that some error mentioned `method`. ([PR #236])

### Known gaps

- **CAP-0086 is not covered.** CAP-0086 (sparse-map host functions) has no
  corresponding top-level XDR type — testing it for real requires a
  deployed Soroban contract that calls
  `sparse_map_new_from_linear_memory`/`sparse_map_unpack_to_linear_memory`.
  As of this release, the latest published `soroban-sdk` (27.0.6) does not
  expose these host functions, so no such contract can be built and
  verified without hand-crafting the host-function ABI — which this
  project's no-guessing rule forbids. See `docs/protocol-28.md` for
  details and what would need to be true upstream before this gap can be
  closed. ([757e1e7])
- **CAP-0085 Soroban-level (not just XDR-level) behavior is not covered.**
  The XDR fixtures above prove the wire representation round-trips; they
  do not exercise an actual deployed externally-managed-executable
  contract fleet end-to-end, which would require deploying and verifying a
  real Protocol 28 contract using this brand-new executable type. The Rust
  `stellar` CLI **27.1.0** installed while authoring this pack had no
  supported external-reference deployment flow. The current **28.0.0**
  release can resolve and invoke existing external references, but its
  `stellar contract deploy` command still has no direct
  `--executable-owner`/`--executable-tag` construction option; the draft
  [`stellar-cli` PR #2659](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli/pull/2659)
  is the upstream candidate to unblock that gap. The exact commands,
  re-check date, and distinction between reference resolution and direct
  deployment are recorded in [`docs/protocol-28.md`](docs/protocol-28.md) and
  tracked by [issue #8](https://github.com/StellarCanary/ProtocolCanary-Fixtures/issues/8).
  ([757e1e7])
- `protocol-27/` is intentionally empty; see `protocol-27/README.md`.
  ([757e1e7])

### Upstream dependency change

- `StellarCanary/Protocol-Canary`'s `canary-xdr` crate gained
  `ContractExecutable` decode/encode support (previously only
  `StellarValue` was supported), so that the CAP-0085 fixtures above are
  actually runnable rather than merely well-formed TOML. See that
  repository's own changelog for the corresponding entry. ([757e1e7])
