# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository scaffold: `schemas/`, `tools/validate/`, `tests/`, `docs/`,
  CI validation workflow.
- `schemas/fixture-v1.schema.json` documenting the fixture format
  implemented by `StellarCanary/Protocol-Canary`'s `canary-fixtures` crate.
- `tools/validate/validate.py`: structural validator (schema conformance,
  unique IDs, protocol/surface enums, source references, referenced-file
  existence). No live-network or execution behavior.
- Protocol 28 compatibility pack (`protocol-28/`):
  - `p28-xdr-cap83-empty-tx-set` — CAP-0083 `StellarValue`
    (`STELLAR_VALUE_EMPTY_TX_SET`) round-trip, built with the official
    `stellar-xdr` 28.0.0 crate.
  - `p28-xdr-cap85-external-ref-roundtrip` and
    `p28-xdr-cap85-external-ref-malformed` — CAP-0085
    `ContractExecutable` (`CONTRACT_EXECUTABLE_EXTERNAL_REF`) round-trip
    and malformed-input rejection.
  - `p28-rpc-network` — Protocol 28 `getNetwork` identity check, verified
    live against `soroban-testnet.stellar.org`.
  - `p28-soroban-native-asset-name` — a Soroban simulation smoke fixture
    (SEP-41 `name()` on the reserved native-asset contract), verified live
    against `soroban-testnet.stellar.org`.
- `docs/protocol-28.md` documenting exactly what this pack checks, what it
  does not, and why.

### Known gaps

- **CAP-0086 is not covered.** CAP-0086 (sparse-map host functions) has no
  corresponding top-level XDR type — testing it for real requires a
  deployed Soroban contract that calls
  `sparse_map_new_from_linear_memory`/`sparse_map_unpack_to_linear_memory`.
  As of this release, the latest published `soroban-sdk` (27.0.6) does not
  expose these host functions, so no such contract can be built and
  verified without hand-crafting the host-function ABI — which this
  project's no-guessing rule forbids. See `docs/protocol-28.md` for
  details and what would need to be true upstream before this gap can be
  closed.
- **CAP-0085 Soroban-level (not just XDR-level) behavior is not covered.**
  The XDR fixtures above prove the wire representation round-trips; they
  do not exercise an actual deployed externally-managed-executable
  contract fleet end-to-end, which would require deploying and verifying a
  real Protocol 28 contract using this brand-new executable type.
- `protocol-27/` is intentionally empty; see `protocol-27/README.md`.

### Upstream dependency change

- `StellarCanary/Protocol-Canary`'s `canary-xdr` crate gained
  `ContractExecutable` decode/encode support (previously only
  `StellarValue` was supported), so that the CAP-0085 fixtures above are
  actually runnable rather than merely well-formed TOML. See that
  repository's own changelog for the corresponding entry.
